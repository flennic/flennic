### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maximilian Pfundstein and I am a software developer and data scientist located in Stockholm, Sweden.

My expertise lies in software development and data science. As a software developer I have experience in frontend and backend and gathered more in-depth experience in .NET over the past couple of years. Also, I have some knowledge in maintaining Windows and Linux servers as well as some networking. As a data scientist I have a strong basis in statistical modelling, Machine Learning and Deep Learning and I am quite attracted to Bayesian statistics.

In general I enjoy working with computers. At the moment, I am trying to do some digital graphics processing with Affinity Designer and Photo.

You can find some of my projects and contributions here on GitHub.
