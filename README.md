### Hi there ❄️

My name is Maximilian Pfundstein and I am a software developer, a DevOps Engineer and a data scientist located in Stockholm, Sweden.

As a software developer I have experience in frontend as well as backend development and gathered more in-depth experience in .NET over the past couple of years. Also, I know a couple of programming languages, frameworks and databases and I have knowledge in maintaining Windows and Linux servers as well as some networking and DevOps. As a data scientist I have a strong basis in statistical modelling, Machine Learning and Deep Learning and I am quite attracted to Bayesian statistics.

In general, I enjoy working with computers.

You can find some of my projects and contributions here on GitHub.
