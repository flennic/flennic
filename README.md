### Hi there 👋

My name is Maximilian Pfundstein and I am a software developer and data scientist 👨‍💻 located in Stockholm, Sweden.

My main experience lies in .NET, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and statistical modelling, but honestly I love everything that has to do with coding and statistics 😄

I also have an interest in digital graphics processing and try to educate myself in my free time.

You can find some of my projects and contributions here on GitHub.
